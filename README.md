# Picture-Tracker-Project
In this project I created a shell script to identify all image files within a set of directories and move those files to a new directory without altering the original images.
I started with a zipped file (Pictures.zip) filled with folders of images. 
My ideas was to create a shell script to complete the following:
  Create three folders called: JPG, PNG, TIFF.
  Locate all .jpg , .png, and .tiff files inside the folder and copy each into their respective folder. 
  Create a new file called PictureCounts.md
  Count how many times each file type occurs and log the results to the PictureCounts.md file. 
I found this script to be very useful as it allows the user to copy a large quantity of images in a very short amount of time.
